= Disabling interrupt processing for CPUs where pinned containers are running

[role="_abstract"]
To achieve low latency for workloads, some containers require that the CPUs they are pinned to do not process device interrupts. You can use the `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` pod annotation to control whether device interrupts are processed on CPUs where the pinned containers are running.

To disable interrupt processing for CPUs where containers belonging to individual pods are pinned, ensure that `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `false` in the performance profile. In the pod specification, set the `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` pod annotation to `disable`, as demonstrated in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
      irq-load-balancing.crio.io: "disable"
spec:
    runtimeClassName: performance-<profile_name>
...
