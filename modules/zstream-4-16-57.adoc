== Fixed issues

The following issues are fixed for this release:

* Before this update, a bug in the `oc adm inspect --all-namespaces` command construction prevented the `must-gather` utility from correctly gathering information about leases, `csistoragecapacities` resources, and the `assisted-installer` namespace. With this release, the `must-gather` utility gathers the information correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-66106[OCPBUGS-66106])

* Before this update, aggregated API servers on {product-title} used in-memory loopback certificates that were valid for only one year. With this release, these servers now use in-memory loopback certificates that are valid for three years. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-74110[OCPBUGS-74110])

* Before this update, when a hosted cluster was configured with a proxy URL such as `http://user:pass@host`, the authentication header was not getting forwarded by the Konnectivity proxy to the user proxy, which failed authentication. With this release, the proper authentication header is sent when a user and password are specified in the proxy URL. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-74375[OCPBUGS-74375])
