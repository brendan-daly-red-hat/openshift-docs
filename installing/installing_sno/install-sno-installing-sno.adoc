toc::[]

You can install {sno} by using either the web-based Assisted Installer or the `coreos-installer` tool to generate a discovery ISO image. The discovery ISO image writes the {op-system-first} system configuration to the target installation disk, so that you can run a single-cluster node to meet your needs.

Consider using {sno} when you want to run a cluster in a low-resource or an isolated environment for testing, troubleshooting, training, or small-scale project purposes.

== Installing {sno} manually

To install {product-title} on a single node, first generate the installation ISO, and then boot the server from the ISO. You can monitor the installation using the `openshift-install` installation program.
